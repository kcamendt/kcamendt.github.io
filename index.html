            <h3>We Believe in Putting the Clients First</h3>
            <p>This philosophy underscores everything we do. But for us, Clients First
              is more than just a philosophy - or how we do business... it's who we are.&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>HERE ARE A FEW QUOTES FROM&nbsp;SOME PRETTY SMART PEOPLE WHO AGREE WITH
              US&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>"I don't build in order to have Clients. I have Clients in order to build."
              - Ayn Rand&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>"Good&nbsp;counselors lack no Clients." - William Shakespeare&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>"If you work just for money, you'll&nbsp;never make it, but if you love
              what you're doing and you always put the Customer first, success will be
              yours." - Ray Kroc
              <br>
              <br>&nbsp;“The purpose of business is to create and keep a Customer." - Peter
              F. Drucker&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>“Profit in&nbsp;business comes from repeat Customers, Customers that boast
              about your project or service, and that bring friends with them.” - W.
              Edwards Deming
              <br>
              <br>&nbsp;"There is only one boss. The Customer. And he can fire everybody
              in the company from the chairman on down, simply by spending his money
              somewhere else.” - Sam Walton&nbsp;
              <br>
              <br>"Every&nbsp;company's greatest assets are its Customers, because without
              Customers there is no company.” - Michael Leboeuf</p>
